# Data Science Portfolio

## Introduction
This repository contains various data science projects completed as part of my coursework. Each portfolio explores a different dataset and applies various data science techniques, including data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and modeling.

## Portfolio 1: E-commerce Dataset Analysis
### Objective
Analyze an e-commerce dataset to understand user ratings and reviews.

### Key Tasks
- Data cleaning: Removing missing data and handling outliers.
- Descriptive statistics: Summarizing the data.
- Exploratory analysis: Plotting and analyzing correlations between features.
- Model building: Predicting user ratings using linear regression.

## Portfolio 2: E-commerce Dataset Part 2
### Objective
Predict user ratings using linear regression models and explore the impact of feature selection and data split sizes on model performance.

### Key Tasks
- Data exploration: Understanding the dataset.
- Feature selection: Identifying important features for the model.
- Model training: Building and evaluating linear regression models.

## Portfolio 3: Mobile Price Data Analysis
### Objective
Predict mobile phone price ranges using classification models.

### Key Tasks
- Data cleaning: Handling missing values.
- Exploratory analysis: Studying feature correlations.
- Model building: Training and evaluating classification models like Logistic Regression and KNN.

## Portfolio 4: COVID-19 Vaccination Analysis
### Objective
Analyze COVID-19 vaccination data to understand factors influencing vaccination rates.

### Key Tasks
- Data cleaning: Handling missing values and filtering data.
- Exploratory analysis: Visualizing relationships between features.
- Model building: Predicting vaccination rates using linear regression.
- Analysis: Grouping data by income level and analyzing vaccination rates.
